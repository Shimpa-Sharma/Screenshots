These are screenshots of the project I did in my 3rd year bachelors. The front-end uses technologies like ASP.Net and C# while the backend of ths project is in MySQL.
The project is about Online Cab Service and includes the following functinalities:
1. A registered user can book a cab according to his car preference.
2. The user can view his booking details and driver information using the booking ID.
3. The user can cancel his booking.
4. Registered users can enroll to become drivers.
5. Registered users can view all driver details.
6. New users can register in the web application.
7. Users can provide anonymous feedback.
8. The admin can insert/update/delete users (Riders and drivers).
